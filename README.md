Hello World



And hello interested travellers. Welcome to the not so secret repository of the EEDA pre-processing code. 

It is divided in two parts:

1st- The Main code... If you want to run it, just open it, change the data paths to fit your need and execute!

2nd- The Functions... Here are all the functions that are used in the Main. 


Thats it :) Have Fun!
